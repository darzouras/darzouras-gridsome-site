What have I been up to? And [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

Enjoying the first spring in my new home with my husband and trying desperately to keep my small vegetable garden alive.

Recently went from vegetarian to full vegan. The current state of animal agriculture is unsustainable. I'm trying to do my part for the environment by refraining from animal products.

## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for [160over90](https://160over90.com). Practicing CSS magic and passing my practice to willing colleagues. Helping assess web projects built across the 160over90 digital teams on web accessibility. Also doing a little bit of web design.

Like tons of other developers as well as the entire 160over90 team, I'm working from home for the foreseeable future due to the threat of Covid-19. Love being able to save nearly two hours a day on my commute and love hanging out with my furry babies all day.

Preparing to eventually take the [Web Accessibility Standards certification exam](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification).
