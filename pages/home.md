Hi! I'm Darlene, a front end developer and artist. My dream is to become a Pok√®mon trainer.

I started building websites on Geocities in the early 2000s, continued to dabble in simple web development through middle school (... mostly Sailor Moon fan sites), then as a teenager never considered that it could be a career. I got my first degree in studio art, then my master's degree in art education, but find myself making websites again.

This is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and [NetliflyCMS](https://netlifycms.org) powered website and blog. Eleventy generates my template bits into static content and is then served by Netlify.
