OK, so, I haven't been great at keeping this updated but I also meant to do it only when projects launched and stuff and I GUESS I've been working on the same thing for the past few months and it still hasn't gone live.

But you know what has gone live? My promotion. Starting Nov 1 I will be the team's first ever UX Developer. P r e t t y exciting.

The agency I've been working for has also officially been rebranded to 160 over 90. I helped launch [the new website](https://160over90.com) (and the replacement for [thisisfusion.com](https://thisisfusion.com)).

Had fun doing this one! I got a chance to use SVG filters to create duotone images on the Work and Capabilities pages. I'm always excited to use grid as well, which we used for each of the case study callouts.
