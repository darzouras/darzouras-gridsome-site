I was able to catch most of the [Jamstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/) Virtual 2020 today! Unfortunately could not take the day off so I missed quite a bit and couldn't devote my attention to it fully.

Here are some things that I don't want to forget!

* Try [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)! NetlifyCMS sometimes has me wanting a little bit more from its service, but potentially might be due mostly to my own shortcomings in knowledge about what it offers. We've been looking potentially into some CMS alternatives at work and this might be a little bit 
* Maybe look into [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as well for CMS
* (Not fully related to the conference) look into automated front-end testing!! What is necessary in what situations?
