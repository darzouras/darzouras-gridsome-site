What have I been up to? And [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

My husband and I are wrapping up our first year of home-ownership, finally working on selecting our last big furniture pieces and actually settling in.

Personal and professional life bleeding into each other a little bit as I have been working from home since mid-March. Love that commute has been removed and that I get to hang out with my furry babies all day.

## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for [160over90](https://160over90.com). Practicing CSS magic and passing my practice to willing colleagues. Helping assess web projects built across the 160over90 digital teams on web accessibility. Also doing a little bit of web design. Working from home for the foreseeable future.

Preparing to eventually take the [Web Accessibility Standards certification exam](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification).
