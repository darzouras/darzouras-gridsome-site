Hi! I'm Darlene, a front end developer and artist. My dream is to become a Pok√®mon trainer.

I started building Sailor Moon fan sites on Geocities in the early 2000s, continued to dabble in simple web development through middle school, but never considered that it could be a career. My first degree is in studio art, then my master's degree in art education, but here I am making websites again.
